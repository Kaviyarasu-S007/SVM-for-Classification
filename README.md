# Cat and Dog Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

The dataset contains two subdirectories, `train` and `test`, each further divided into `cat` and `dog` folders.

## Files

- `Model_Training`: Python script containing the implementation of the SVM for image classification.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (please download and place the dataset here).
- `Test_App`: A streamlit app to test the model

## Usage

1. Download the Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Install the required packages using the command:

    ```bash
    Scikit learn
    ```

3. Run the `Model_` script:
